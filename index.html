  <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>At the head of the <a href="https://www.biw.kuleuven.be/biosyst/mebios/multicellular-system-dynamics-lab">Muticellular System Dynamics Lab</a> at KU Leuven, 
       I work at the interface of active matter physics and mechanobiology.
       I love building computational models of multicellular systems.
       For this, we mainly develop agent-based models focusing on mechanics that represent interaction between cells and subcellular elements.
       In our group, we have been spearheading the development of detailed foam-like descriptions of tissues.
       These models are applied to various biological and technological processes, including embryonal development, tumor growth, in biofabrication operations (such as 3D printing), or in bacterial biofilms.

      <b>Active foam dynamics of tissue spheroid fusion</b>

      <p>It has long been known that multicellular systems may exhibit liquid-like behaviors.
      For examples, tissues will wet or dewet from a surface or phase separate like water and oil during cell sorting.
      When brought together two spheroids (spherical droplets of cell material) will spontaneously fuse, a behavior again very similar to the coalescence of liquid droplets with surface tension.
      When probed by mechanical tests, tissues appear solid-like, and these liquid-like behaviors stem from active cell forces driving cell rearrangements and cytoskeletal remodelling, 
      processes which dominate the long-timescale viscous response of a tissue.</p>

      <p>In this work, we studied the fusion of tissue spheroids to investigate the link between active properties at the cell scale and macroscopic fusion dynamics.
         For this, we performed a detailed experimental analysis of both the fusion process as well as tissue microstructure and motility at the cellular scale.
         We find that cells in fusing tissues are rather active, with frequent cellular rearrangments.
         We then compared these experiments to simulations of an active foam model of spheroid fusion.
         In these model, cells are represented as volume-preserving 'bubbles' with surface tension and adhesive tension determining the tissue microstructure.
         We then added a minimal model of cell migration, based on a protrusive/retractive pressure along the direction of a randomly diffusing cell polarity.
         Bringing together two of these simulated spheroids, they spontaneously fuse into a single, bigger spheroids
         We then mapped out how cell-scale properties govern the outcome of the fusion process. 
         From this, we propose a dimensionless activity parameter that captures both whether the tissue if fluid- or solid-like and predicts the outcome of the fusion process.

         <b>Rigidity transitions in a 3D active foam model of cell monolayers with frictional contact interactions</b>
        
         <p>The classic vertex model predicts a density-independent rigidity transition to occur when preferred cell shape exceeds a critical shape index. 
            In other words, factors that drive cell elongation, such as adhesion / reduced interfacial tension will help unjam the tissue.
            This prediction is in marked contrast with the behavior of colloid-like (active) particles. 
            For these particles, adhesion will inhibit particle rearrangments and thus drive the system towards a glass or jamming transition.

          <p>
            We developed a 3D foam-like model of cell monolayers in which cells are represented as discrete entities with explicit contact interactions. 
            This model naturally represents foam-like behavior (where the microstructure is determined by the balance of tension at various interfaces): 
            At high cell-cell adhesion (or reduced interfacial tension at the cell-cell interface), cells become columnar and can even extrude from the monolayer.
            At high cell-substrate adhesion, cells become spread out and squamous.
            The foam was turned into an 'active foam' by including a minimal model of cell motility, which includes both a polar component (net migration) and a dipolar component (cell elongation).
            Our model captures the essential features of both vertex models (fluidity driven by cell deformation) and colloid-like models (fluidity driven by debonding).
            Thus, we use the model to draw a unified phase diagram of rigidity transitions in foam-like materials.
            Moreover, we were able to explore the effect of cell-cell friction. We show that it drastically reduces cell rearrangements (thus appearing to solidify the tissue).
            However, this was not found to be a (typical) rigidity transition, since the static yield stress in a shear experiment remains zero, even when increasing cell-cell friction.

         <b>Emergence of bidirectional cell laning from collective contact guidance</b>
        
         <p>In this work, we investigate a remarkable finding: 
           When we put cells are let to migrate on micropatterned grooves, they spontaneously form very large collective streams or 'lanes' that align with the direction of the groove.
           These streams have no preferred direction, so streams of opposite direction appear and compete with each other, leading to a gradual coarsening into stable, bidrectional lanes.
           We use a combination of active hydrodynamic theory (work of Carles Blanch Mercader) and particle-based simulations to explain the emergence of these lanes.
           We find that micropatterned grooves can be thought of as an aligning field, for example through anisotropic friction, which is lower in the direction of the grooves.
           This triggers a disordered-to-polar phase transition that stabilizes into large polar lanes.
           Both simulations and hydrodynamic theory predict a phase diagram of collective streams with varying anisotropy ratio (in the experiments modulated by groove depth) and flocking strength.

          <p>
            The flocking strength is based on the existence of a velocity-polarity coupling: 
            As neighbours influence a cell's velocity, the cell starts to reorient into its changed velocity. 
            Thus, if this coupling is sufficiently strong, mechanical interactions (which can be purely repulsive) between adjacent cells drive a disordered-to-polar phase transition.
            While not observed in experiments, even without any grooves the disordered-to-polar phase transition is expected to occur at high enough flocking strength.
            Below you see a movie of a <i>very large</i> simulation of a polar fluid of self-propelled particles at high flocking strength.
            With time, polar domains grow ever larger and very large collective streams, spanning thousands of particles, appear.
            Since there is no global aligning field in this case, there is no prefered direction in the collective movements.
